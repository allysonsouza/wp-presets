The WP Presets plugin allows you to fill your WordPress with previously defined demo/test data in just a few seconds allowing you to test it without the need to manually change the settings every time.

This plugin hasn't been developed to be working on production sites. The goal with it is mostly to allow you to test plugins that require you to change the settings all the time.

Currently, you are only able to change WordPress user meta details, but the goal will be to bring more WordPress and WooCommerce settings. We hope to make it easy in the long term to extend and bring more plugins settings.
