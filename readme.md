The Presets plugin allows you to fill your WordPress installation with previously defined settings in just a few seconds, allowing you to test it without the need to change the settings every time manually.

This plugin hasn't been developed to be working on production sites, and it's mostly for testing plugins that require you to change the settings all the time.

You can see more on the WordPress.org plugin page: https://wordpress.org/plugins/presets/

Feel free to contact us if you are looking to contrbute on the plugin and if you have questions about it: https://felipels.com/contact/
