The Presets plugin allows you to fill your WordPress with previously defined settings in just a few seconds allowing you to test it without the need to manually change the settings every time.

Currently, you are able to change WordPress user meta details and define plugins to be activated/deactivate when a preset is triggered, but the goal will be to bring more WordPress and WooCommerce settings. We hope to make it easy in the long term to extend and bring more plugins settings.

This plugin hasn't been developed to be working on production sites. The goal with it is mostly to allow you to test plugins that require you to change the settings all the time.
