== Description ==

The WP Presets plugin allows you to fill your WordPress with previously defined demo/test data in just a few seconds allowing you to test it without the need to manually change the settings every time.

This plugin hasn't been developed to be working on production sites. The goal with it is mostly to allow you to test plugins that require you to change the settings all the time.

Currently, you are only able to change WordPress user meta details, but the goal will be to bring more WordPress and WooCommerce settings. We hope to make it easy in the long term to extend and bring more plugins settings.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or the plugin zip on the WP Admin panel (Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Should I use this plugin? =

That plugin is not for production sites. it means that it won't probably make sense if you want to use it on your live site. It was created mostly with support teams and maybe even developers in mind that need to test things quickly and changing specific settings is required for that.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
